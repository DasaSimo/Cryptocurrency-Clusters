If you want to invest and create new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for your potential client, a prominent bank, the vast universe of cryptocurrencies may be confusing. In this task we tried to solve this problem and we created a report â€“ brief recommendation that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and determine whether they can be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Data preparation and unsupervised learning

We worked with raw data, so first we needed to process it to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known classification system, we used unsupervised learning. We used several clustering algorithms to explore whether the cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies. 
We performed dimensionality reduction with PCA. Next, the reduction of the dataset dimensions with t-SNE was performed and the results were inspected visually. In order to accomplish this task, we ran t-SNE on the principal components: the output of the PCA transformation. Then we created a scatter plot of the t-SNE output and performed cluster Analysis with k-Means

### Brief Recommendation

There are six clusters formed. The task is not completed yet, and the final status will be updated over here shortly ðŸ˜Š.
